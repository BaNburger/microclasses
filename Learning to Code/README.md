# Welcome to Learning to Code
*Learning to Code* is our interactive and virtual Microclass, teaching you the basics of creating code and building products. This is for you if you want to get started in one of the following crucial areas of entrepreneurship:
`üõ†Ô∏è Engineering`
`üéÅ Product`
`üé® Design`

## Why would you want to take this course
1. You are non-technical and want to get your feet wet
2. You are writing scripts for your studies and want to learn a more structured way of building code
3. You are an entrepreneur who wants to put an idea to reality
4. You want to prepare for the in-person Microclasses

## What we will do here
Throughout this tutorial, you will learn from the groud up how to build a specific product. We want to build *Netthings+*, a content delivery service, that might serve entertainment or useful content based on a recommendation system to logged in users. In the process, we will add a number of features which you are free to make your own.
(Everything we do here is under the GNU 3.0 license, so you are free to take the code you produce and make a company out of that. In fact, I'd encourage you to do so üí™)
