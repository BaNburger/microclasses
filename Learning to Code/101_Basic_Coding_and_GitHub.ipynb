        "# Using Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 1: Introduction to Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Colab, short for \"Google Colaboratory,\" is a free cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code in a Jupyter Notebook-like environment. It's a powerful tool for data science, machine learning, and collaborative coding projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 2: Accessing Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "To access Google Colab, you can visit the website at colab.research.google.com. You'll need a Google account to log in.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 3: Creating a New Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you're logged in, click on \"New Notebook\" to create a new notebook. This will open a fresh, untitled notebook in a new tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 4: Notebook Interface\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook interface in Google Colab is similar to Jupyter Notebooks. It consists of cells, which can contain either code or text. You can add new cells by clicking the \"+ Code\" or \"+ Text\" buttons, or by using keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+M B (for adding a new cell below the current one).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 5: Running Code\n",
        "\n",
        "In a code cell, you can write and run Python code. To execute a cell, you can press Shift+Enter, or click the Play button (â–¶) in the cell's top-left corner. Code execution happens on Google's servers, and you can see the output below the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 6: Text Cells\n",
        "\n",
        "Text cells are used to write explanations, documentation, or notes. You can format text using Markdown. To run a text cell, just click inside it and press Shift+Enter.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 7: Saving Your Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Colab automatically saves your work to Google Drive, so there's no need to manually save the notebook. You can also download it as a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or various other formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 8: Hardware Acceleration\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Colab provides free access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for faster computation. You can enable these accelerators by going to \"Runtime\" -> \"Change runtime type\" and selecting your preferred hardware accelerator.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 9: Collaboration and Sharing\n",
        "\n",
        "You can collaborate with others on the same notebook by sharing it with them. Click on the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner to generate a shareable link.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 10: Additional Libraries and Data\n",
        "\n",
        "You can install additional Python libraries and upload data files directly in Google Colab. Use commands like !pip install library_name to install libraries and the file upload feature for data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 11: Getting Help\n",
        "\n",
        "If you need help or have questions, Google Colab provides a \"Help\" menu with access to documentation and keyboard shortcuts.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, you can start by printing a simple message. The classic \"Hello, World!\" program is your first step:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "name = \"Alice\"\n",
        "age = 25\n",

        "\n",
        "Python has various data types. Here are a few:\n",
        "\n",
        "`int`: Integers (e.g., 5, -2, 100)\n",
        "\n",
        "`float`: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, 0.5)\n",
        "\n",
        "`str`: Strings (text) enclosed in quotes (e.g., \"Hello\")\n",
        "\n",
        "`bool`: Boolean values (True or False)\n",
        "\n",
        "##5. Basic Operations: Math and Logic\n",
        "\n",
        "Python can perform various operations, such as addition, subtraction, and logical comparisons:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Addition\n",
        "result = 5 + 3\n",
        "\n",
        "# Subtraction\n",

        "```\n",
        "The code checks if age is 18 or older.\n",

        "##7. Loops: Repeating Actions\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops let you repeat actions. A common loop is the for loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "Functions are reusable pieces of code. You can define your own functions or use built-in ones:\n",
        "\n",

        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
