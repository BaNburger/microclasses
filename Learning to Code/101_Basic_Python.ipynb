It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

    "Python syntax is designed to be intuitive and close to human language, which often makes Python code highly readable and maintainable. Here are some key aspects:\n",
    "- **Indentation**: Unlike other programming languages that use braces to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation. This requirement helps maintain a clean, readable structure in your code.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing**: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don’t need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. This makes Python very flexible, but it also means you need to be aware of type errors.\n",
    "- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier but may affect performance. This characteristic is advantageous for beginners as it provides immediate feedback."
